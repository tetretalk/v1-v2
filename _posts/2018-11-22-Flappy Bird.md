# Description

Do you want to play the original Flappy Bird game? Then you are right here! Originally, Flappy Bird was a very successful app made for iPhone but thanks to the HTML5 it is now available for all sorts of devices. Now you can play Flappy Bird online on your PC, mobile, smartphone or tablet without download or registration. It does not matter whether you prefer using Android, Windows or iOS operating system. In Flappy Bird Online, players are in charge to control a yellow bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game will be over if the bird touches one of 
the pipes! It might sound easy but it is really hard to control the bird and very small gaps between the pipes make it also very challenging. Have fun!
